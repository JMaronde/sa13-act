        <h3>They're Loyal!<br></h3>
        <p>If you were to fall down and hurt yourself, who do you think would be the first person to your side? 
            That's right! Your dog! Your cat would probably still be asleep.

        <h3>Playing with them is more fun!<br></h3>   
        <p>With dogs, you can run around with them outside for as long as you want, but with cats, all it takes is one millisecond
            of boredom for them to just leave until they want food again.
